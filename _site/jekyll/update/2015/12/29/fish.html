    <p>I’ve been wondering for a while how some of the instructors get the cool autocomplete suggestions in their terminal window but have been completely unable to figure it out. I finally learned that it isn’t something you can do with bash, but that there’s a totally different shell called fish that has this functionality built in! I made the decision to switch over break thinking that it would be as easy as switching from Terminal to iTerm 2.</p>

<p>Turns out that wasn’t quite the case.</p>

<p>I learned that fish, while similar to bash, has quite a few differences, especially in how the configuration is done. I was hoping to be able to just copy my bash_profile into a new file, but fish works in an entirely different way. Instead of aliasing common commands, I had to create separate .fish function files and create a function for each of my previous aliases.</p>

<p>For example, my old alias used to look like:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">
alias gpom="git push origin master"
</code></p>

<p>But in fish I now have a file located at <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.config/fish/functions/gpom.fish</code> which contains:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">
function gpom
  git push origin master
end
</code></p>

<p>I also ran into trouble with the prompt. I had a pretty customized prompt with the ‘dirty’ git status being a main feature of it. It took quite a bit of Googling, but there are people out there who have solved this problem. I ended out using <a href="https://github.com/mariuszs/informative_git_prompt/blob/master/__informative_git_prompt.fish">a solution from Mariusz Smykula</a> with a few tweaks of my own.</p>

<p>The prompt itself it also strange because it is located in another fish function file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">fish_prompt.fish</code>. There is no ‘PS1’ like you would find in bash, just another function called fish_prompt. I ended out setting mine up like this:</p>

<p>```
function fish_prompt –description ‘Write out the prompt’</p>

<p>set -l last_status $status</p>

<p>set_color 55f914
  echo -n (basename $PWD)
  set_color normal</p>

<p>echo -n ‘ ‘
  __informative_git_prompt</p>

<p>if not test $last_status -eq 0
    set_color $fish_color_error
  end</p>

<p>set_color yellow
  echo -n ‘ ➾ ‘</p>

<p>set_color normal
end
```</p>

<p>Now that I have everything set up similar to bash, I’m digging all of the autocomplete and search features I have with fish. It took a while to get it all up and running, but I think it might be worth it!</p>
